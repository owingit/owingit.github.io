                Thanks for dropping by my virtual space! I'm Owen, a research scientist based jointly in Boulder, Colorado and Laramie, Wyoming. I am fascinated by <b>animal communication</b> and <b>collective behavior</b> and employ a wide variety of computational techniques to study the overlap of these phenomena across nature. Please have a look around!
