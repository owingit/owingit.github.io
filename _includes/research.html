    <div>
        I am a computer science ph.d student at the university of colorado boulder, 2020 cohort, and member of the <a href="peleglab.com">peleg lab.</a> I have a spanning interest in complex systems - especially swarm systems - and collective intelligence. Some of my research goals are to understand how living complex systems make decisions and to classify and recognize intelligence at different scales of individuals. My main methods are agent-based modeling, numerical analysis, machine learning, and network science.
