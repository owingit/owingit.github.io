<div>
    i am a computer science ph.d student at the university of colorado boulder, 2020 cohort, and member of the <a href="peleglab.com">peleg lab.</a> i have a spanning interest in complex systems - especially swarm systems - and collective intelligence. some of my research goals are to understand how living complex systems make decisions and to classify and recognize intelligence at <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-an-individual-biology-seeks-clues-in-information-theory-20200716/">different scales of individuals</a>. my main methods are agent-based modeling, numerical analysis, machine learning, and network science.
