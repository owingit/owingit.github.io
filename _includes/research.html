    <div>
        I am a computer science ph.d student at the university of colorado boulder, 2020 cohort, and member of the <a href="peleglab.com">peleg lab.</a> I have a spanning interest in complex systems - especially swarm systems - and collective intelligence. Some of my research goals are to understand how living complex systems make decisions and to classify and recognize intelligence at different scales of individuals. My main methods are agent-based modeling, numerical analysis, machine learning, and network science.

        <h3>1. Firefly classification based on spatiotemporal flash pattern analysis with recurrent neural networks</h3>
            <article>Fireflies are some of the most well-loved and cherished insects around the world.
Found on every continent except Antarctica, these bioluminescent beetles have captured the human imagination for centuries.
Yet, fireflies are largely neglected in global conservation efforts.
While relatively few monitoring programs currently exist, growing anecdotal reports and expert opinions suggest that global firefly populations are
indeed in trouble.
To better understand the threats faced by fireflies, we present a new high-
throughput artificial intelligence pipeline to identify and monitor firefly populations, enabling long-term density estimation and measurement of behavioral variations in the presence of environmental
factors like extreme weather variations and light pollution.
Using our accurate, simple, and inexpensive novel stereoscopic camera strategy for recording firefly flashing displays, we produce temporal trajectories for individuals within a population.
These are passed through a gated recurrent unit RNN, which has been pre-trained on synthetic characteristic temporal sequences for each of the species, to produce accurate predictions of the species present in the stereoscopic recording.
We present a trained model that currently can classify between six different species with an accuracy of over eighty-five percent.
With this method we can understand the locations and densities of firefly populations throughout the United States.
By illuminating threats and evaluating the conservation status of firefly species around the
world, we seek the preservation of the magical lights of fireflies for future generations.</article>

        <h3>2. Emergent periodicity of swarming fireflies</h3>
        <article>
            Left alone, Photinus carolinus fireflies flash without an intrinsic period, making it uncertain when they may flash next. Yet when gathering at the mating lek in large swarms, these fireflies transition into predictability, synchronizing with their neighbors with a rhythmic periodicity. Here we propose a mechanism for emergence of synchrony and periodicity, and formulate the principle in a mathematical framework. Remarkably, with no fitting parameters, analytic predictions from this simple principle and framework agree strikingly well with data. Next, we add further sophistication to the framework using a computational model featuring groups of random oscillators via integrate-and-fire interactions controlled by a tunable parameter. This agent-based model of P. carolinus fireflies interacting in swarms of increasing density also shows quantitatively similar phenomenology and reduces to the analytic framework in the appropriate limit of the tunable parameter. We discuss our findings and note that the resulting dynamics follow the style of a decentralized follow-the-leader synchronization, where any of the randomly flashing individuals may take the role of the leader of any subsequent synchronized flash burst.

        <h3>3. Synchronization dynamics of firefly-LED systems</h3>
        <article>Firefly communication in mating swarms results in synchronized flash behavior for two North American species.  This collective behavior results in characteristic flash patterns with continuous or intermittent structure, depending on the species. Using controlled density experiments where small groups of fireflies are exposed to rhythmic, controlled LED flashes in dark tents, we examine the range of artificial flash frequencies that produce an aligned phase response from the fireflies.  In both species, we unveil a specific and narrow range of flash frequencies to which individual and small groups of fireflies can successfully entrain. Finally, we demonstrate a minimal set of group conditions sufficient for synchrony at small densities.</article>
