        I am a computer science Ph.D student at the university of colorado boulder in the 2020 cohort, and a member of the <a href="peleglab.com">Peleg lab.</a> I have a spanning interest in complex systems - especially swarm systems and animal groups - and collective behavior. Some of my research goals are to understand how living complex systems make decisions and to classify and recognize intelligence across scales. My main research methods are agent-based modeling, numerical analysis via simulation, machine learning, and network science.

        <h3>1. Firefly classification based on spatiotemporal flash pattern analysis with recurrent neural networks</h3>
            <article><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fireflies are some of the most well-loved and cherished insects around the world. Found on every continent except Antarctica, these bioluminescent beetles have captured the human imagination for centuries. Yet, fireflies are largely neglected in global conservation efforts. While relatively few monitoring programs currently exist, growing anecdotal reports and expert opinions suggest that global firefly populations are indeed in trouble. To better understand the threats faced by fireflies, we present a new high- throughput artificial intelligence pipeline to identify and monitor firefly populations, enabling long-term density estimation and measurement of behavioral variations in the presence of environmental factors like extreme weather variations and light pollution. Using our accurate, simple, and inexpensive novel stereoscopic camera strategy for recording firefly flashing displays, we produce temporal trajectories for individuals within a population. These are passed through a gated recurrent unit RNN, which has been pre-trained on synthetic characteristic temporal sequences for each of the species, to produce accurate predictions of the species present in the stereoscopic recording. We present a trained model that currently can classify between six different species with an accuracy of over eighty-five percent. With this method we can understand the locations and densities of firefly populations throughout the United States. By illuminating threats and evaluating the conservation status of firefly species around the world, we seek the preservation of the magical lights of fireflies for future generations.</p></details></article>

        <h3>2. Emergent periodicity of swarming fireflies</h3>
        <article>
            <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Left alone, Photinus carolinus fireflies flash without an intrinsic period, making it uncertain when they may flash next. Yet when gathering at the mating lek in large swarms, these fireflies transition into predictability, synchronizing with their neighbors with a rhythmic periodicity. Here we propose a mechanism for emergence of synchrony and periodicity, and formulate the principle in a mathematical framework. Remarkably, with no fitting parameters, analytic predictions from this simple principle and framework agree strikingly well with data. Next, we add further sophistication to the framework using a computational model featuring groups of random oscillators via integrate-and-fire interactions controlled by a tunable parameter. This agent-based model of P. carolinus fireflies interacting in swarms of increasing density also shows quantitatively similar phenomenology and reduces to the analytic framework in the appropriate limit of the tunable parameter. We discuss our findings and note that the resulting dynamics follow the style of a decentralized follow-the-leader synchronization, where any of the randomly flashing individuals may take the role of the leader of any subsequent synchronized flash burst.</p></details>

        <h3>3. Synchronization dynamics of firefly-LED systems</h3>
        <article><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Firefly communication in mating swarms results in synchronized flash behavior for two North American species.  This collective behavior results in characteristic flash patterns with continuous or intermittent structure, depending on the species. Using controlled density experiments where small groups of fireflies are exposed to rhythmic, controlled LED flashes in dark tents, we examine the range of artificial flash frequencies that produce an aligned phase response from the fireflies.  In both species, we unveil a specific and narrow range of flash frequencies to which individual and small groups of fireflies can successfully entrain. Finally, we demonstrate a minimal set of group conditions sufficient for synchrony at small densities.</p></details></article>
        <h3>4. Cascade dynamics of synchronized firefly swarms</h3>
        <article>
            <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>P. carolinus lampyrids exhibit discrete synchronization in that their flashes appear together in bursts. Each burst comprises multiple flashes, and the bursts are separated by a time delay of darkness. Many possible evolutionary explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed, but the mechanism and prior emergence of this collective behavior are as yet unknown. Here we attempt to characterize the network structure of the firefly swarm as it can be inferred from the cascade dynamics of firefly flashes. Data for these dynamics are collected in situ and in silicons by experimental and computational methods. Experimentally, three-hundred-sixty degree cameras capture flashing fireflies in dark forests and the resulting videos are stereoscopically aligned and processed to produce myriad time series of three-dimensional positions. We implement algorithms for network inference on these data and generate spatio-temporal network structures in which nodes represent voxels in x,y,z,t space, and edges represent excitations in the flash cascade. The reconstructed networks display interesting physical properties of betweenness centrality and cascade size, notably that spatially central nodes in the embedded network have high betweenness. Most flash cascades pass through the same space, suggesting the emergence of a visual swarm marker. Exploring the synchrony of these fireflies has important mechanistic potential, and may provide inspiration for the design of local rules for resource sharing and remote charging in swarm robotic systems.</p></details>
