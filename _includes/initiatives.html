            <span>Worked on an app to provide refugees access to information regarding food/water/shelter sources on the island of Lesvos, Greece. This led into the user experience research project mentioned in employment.</span>

        <p>Tufts runs a pre-orientation program where a pair of leaders, selected competitively from a pool of juniors and seniors, leads eight incoming first-year students on a five day long backpacking trip in the northern New England wilderness. I was lucky enough to be one of these leaders for two years, leading trips before the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years!</p>

        <p>I traveled to Lesvos, Greece to perform user experience research on the refugee population and how they use technology, namely smartphones. With this research, I co-authored a paper on technology's influential role in the refugee crisis and subsequently went on to do some volunteer user experience analysis for <a href = "www.actionemploirefugies.com">this newly built online job portal for refugees!</a></p>
