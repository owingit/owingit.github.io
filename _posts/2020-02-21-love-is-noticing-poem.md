title: Love is Noticing (poem)

love is noticing
the same butterfly
swooping lazily in the sunlight.
love is watching
the same cloud
rolling gently off the mountaintop.
love is observing
the same fungi
hidden in the understory.
love is found
in that small moment
when you realize youâ€™re in the same world
