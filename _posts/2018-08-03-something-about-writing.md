title: Something about writing

I think what I try to do when writing is bottle up a little bit of the wonder 
and mystery and magic of everything, and do it in such a way that somebody else can come by and drink from my bottle and suddenly feel a rush of ideas as they
become connected to the same stream I had found. It's like providing spring 
water for a wide world of thinkers. I want to deliver a little sensation of
frisson that spreads throughout entire bodies, starting in the brain and 
expanding to the very smallest toes and fingertips of the readers that make the
hike to find my words. I want people to pause while reading because the words
before them are playing instruments in their heart, and the only way to hear 
them properly is by taking a moment of silence. This is how I read, and this
is what I wish to create. Small pockets of space, silence, and calm, scattered
around a busy and bustling world, hidden between two tattered book covers yet in
plain view on the bookshelf. pl

It's not my goal to write plot-driven epic stories of betrayal, war, lust, or 
larger, far more dramatic lines of thinking. There are artists elsewhere with a
superior grasp on those realms of the subconscious. I wish to remain within 
what I know: an ordinary, slow-moving life blessed with love, friendship, 
nature, and art. My stories will not spawn big-screen interpretations or 
television sagas. Instead, readers may well find themselves birdwatching, 
tasting homemade meals at the dinner table with children, hiking through
woodland with light streaming between the trees, or smelling pine needles rubbed between fingertips. The writing I want to make is simply a compilation of 
language that describes the very fabric of daily experience. For what immortal purpose I do not know: yet I do know that every time I take pen to paper, the
same streams of consciousness flow into existence. It's time to do something 
about it.
